  <p>Sleep is something necessary for one's physical health. However, it is also
  something that many young people do not get a lot of. This is because they
  have many other obligations working overtime or doing a lot of schoolwork.
  Some teens and young adults go as far as to skip sleep entirely for a few
  nights to keep up with their work.</p>
