		<h1>Project 1: The Internet and Security</h1>
		<p>In this project, I wanted to convey they message that our Internet data
		is always being tracked down. My video tries to show how whenever we search
		something up, we often encounter ads pertaining to what we search in other
		web pages. Not many people are aware of this and it is important that they
		know so that they will watch what they search.</p>
