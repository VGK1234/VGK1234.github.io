		<h2>Project 2: Video as Installation</h2>
		<p>This video illustrated how our emotions are effected by the internet
		and social media more than we think. When we see one negative post or bad
		news, we often tend to feel miserable for the rest of our day wherever we
		go. However, when	we see one, or often multiple happy posts, our days often
		vastly improve. Today, technology plays a greater role in our moods and
		lives	than ever before due to the creation and expansion of social media, so
		should balance the amount of negative and positive things that we see so we
		do not feel too miserable.</p>
