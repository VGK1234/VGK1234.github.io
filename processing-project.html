	<h1>Processing Project</h1>
	<br>
	<p>In my Art 74 class, I did two projects that involve using Processing
	software. In my first one, I had to create a picture of myself using different
	strokes and shapes. In my second one, I created a ball and made it bounce
	through programming. I recorded the ball bouncing using Debut Screen
	Recording. The video contains some sound.</p>
