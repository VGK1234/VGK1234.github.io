    <h1>My Artist Statement</h1>

    <p>My name is Vinita Kulkarni and I am majoring in Digital Media Art.
    I have always been interested in the arts since I was a child. Since I was
		young, I used to love drawing, painting, and doing crafty things. I mostly
		loved to draw and I also used Paint software to doodle every now and then.
		</p>

    <p>My interest in the Digital Arts began during my later high school years.
		At that time, I started taking a Web Design course and an Animation
		course. I learned how to create web sites using HTML and CSS, and how
		to create stories through animating characters and writing a storyboard.</p>

    <p>Since I started taking classes at SJSU, I have learned how to expand my
		creative and imaginative side through using different software. I have
		learned the basics of how to use many Adobe Creative Cloud programs like
		Photoshop, Illustrator,	InDesign, Dreamweaver, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro.
		I also had the experiences of using Processing, Atom, and Github. Being a
		Digital Media major at SJSU has overall helped me cultivate more
		creative skills and become a better artist overall.</p>

		<p>A portion of the work that I have done is based on technology and how
		it affects society.</p>
