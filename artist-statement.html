		<h2> Artist  Statement </h2>
    <p>My name is Vinita Kulkarni and I am majoring in Digital Media Art.
    I have always been interested in the arts since I was a child. Since I was
		young, I used to love drawing, painting, and doing crafty things. I mostly
		loved to draw and I also used Paint software to doodle every now and then.
		</p>
    <p>My interest in the Digital Arts began during my later high school years.
		At that time, I started taking a Web Design course and an Animation
		course. I learned how to create web sites using HTML and CSS, and how
		to create stories through animating characters and writing a storyboard.
		</p>
    <p>Since I started taking classes at SJSU, I have learned how to expand my
		creative and imaginative side through using different software. I have
		learned the basics of how to use many Adobe Creative Cloud programs like
		Photoshop, Illustrator,	InDesign, Dreamweaver, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro.
		I also had the experiences of using Processing, Atom, and Github. Being a
		Digital Media major at SJSU has overall helped me cultivate more
		creative skills and become a better artist overall.</p>
		<p>A portion of the work that I have done critiques many aspects of
		technology,	specifically the internet. As someone who really loves the
		internet and	technology, I know that there are many great things that it
		has brought. In fact, I probably would not have been a Digital Media major
		if it were not for technological advancements. However, I do think that
		people can rely on technology too much and can encounter a few aspects of
		technology that can be quite dangerous. The message that I aim to send to my
		content	viewers	is to be aware of what they see on the internet and how
		often they see it, so they can stop things from going wrong.</p>
