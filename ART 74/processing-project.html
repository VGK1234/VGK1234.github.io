		<h2>Processing Project</h2>
		<br>
		<p>In my Art 74 class, I did two projects that involve using Processing
		software. In my first one, I had to create a picture of myself using
		different	strokes and shapes. In my second one, I created a ball and made it
		bounce through programming. I recorded the ball bouncing using Debut Screen
		Recording. The video contains some sound.</p>
