		<h2>Animation & Sound</h2>
		<p>In this project, I tried to make a video of the remix montage. As you can
		see, both use the same exact images and	backgrounds. The only difference is
		that some of the images are moving. The emojis are moving across the screen
		as	people inside are walking around and texting. Later, the people outside
		slowly	appear on the screen. In my sound montage, I tried to play the sound
		of a	person typing on the keyboard to emphasize the frustration of people
		texting.</p>
