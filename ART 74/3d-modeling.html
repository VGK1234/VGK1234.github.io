		<h2>Project 3: 3D Modeling</h2>
		<p>Below is a picture of a 3D Model that I created in a program called
		SketchUp. I have attempted to create a cityscape in my project. The objects
		in my model are mostly towers and buildings, which is why I tried to fill
		in the objects with	colors of towers and buildings.</p>
