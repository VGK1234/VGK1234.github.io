	<h1>Remix Montage</h1>
	<p>In my remix montage, I wanted to convey the message that digital
 	techonology has a huge influence on the ways we communicate. Texting with
	trusted friends can be useful when done in moderation, however, if we do it
	more often than	communicating in person, we are more likely to experience
	lonliness. In my montage the people texting are frustrated,	while the people
	outside are happy and cheerful together. This compares how people feel
	communicating behind a screen	and how people communicate in person.</p>
