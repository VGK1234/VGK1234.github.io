		<h2>Project 1: Remix Montage</h2>
		<p>In my remix montage, I wanted to convey the message that digital
	 	techonology has a huge influence on the ways we communicate. Texting with
		trusted friends can be useful when done in moderation, however, if we do it
		more often than	communicating in person, we are more likely to experience
		lonliness. In my montage the people texting are frustrated,	while the people
		outside are happy and cheerful together. This compares how people feel
		communicating behind a screen	and how people communicate in person.</p>
